            <p class="main-p">
                 Originally hailing from our nation’s capital, I attended George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where I received my undergraduate degree in psychology. After a few years of working full-time, my itch for adventure increasingly tugged at me – and I began to seriously step into the world of long-distance hiking. 
            </p>

            <p class="main-p">
                 From thru-hiking the Appalachian Trail, the Pacific Crest Trail, the Camino de Santiago in Spain, and completing major excursions in Turkey and New Zealand, I’ve lost track of the number of blisters, bug-bites and sunburns I’ve experienced. But with each adventure, I was abundantly rewarded with experiencing rich cultures and obtaining a joyful contentedness that nourished my spirit.
            </p>
                    
            <p class="main-p">      
                These wilderness episodes have inspired me to share my knowledge of the outdoors and offer to help everyone – particularly other women – connect with nature and (thanks to my psychology training) with themselves. The goal of my outdoor workshops/classes is to educate, build self-confidence and empower others to step-out of their comfort zones and to hike – literally – to new limits of experience, as I had myself.
            </p>     
            
            <p class="main-p">
                 My passion is taking on new challenges, which is why I entered the exciting field of web development. I see the opportunity to use technology as a bridge to outdoor exploration through online-tutorials and providing other informational tools and resources. 
             </p>  
             
             <p class="main-p">
                When I first entered web development, it immediately reminded me of my very first solo backpacking experience; I recognized I had a lot to learn – but I quickly found fulfillment in the creative aspect of coding along with achieving the satisfaction that results from problem-solving. 
            </p>    

             <p class="main-p">
                I moved to Atlanta and joined <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/" title="Check out DigitalCrafts" class="dc">DigitalCrafts</a>  for a four-month, full-time immersive coding “bootcamp” that began in April 2018. I am currently determined on achieving proficiency in multiple programming languages. I am happy I have embarked on this trail, progress steadily marked, step-by-step.
